Choose one of the following topics below and argue for or against your chosen
topic. Write a 2-5 minute persuasive speech which employs the persuasive 
speech structure learnt in class. 
· Modern life is better.
· Everyone has a responsibility to change the world for the better.
· Social media – victory or vice?
· Teenagers should be more self-reliant.
· A topic of your choosing in negotiation with your teacher.
To persuade the audience, you need to justify your chosen stance using a 
combination of the persuasive techniques reviewed in class
To help you achieve success in this task, make sure you 
remember these things:
Take advantage of the drafting process by submitting 
a complete, quality draft on or before the due date.
Use a variety of persuasive techniques, such as: rule of
three, rhetorical questions, anecdotes, direct address, 
exaggeration, counterarguments, emotive or figurative
language, say it again.
Apply teacher feedback.
Have your final copy proofread by someone else to 
help you spot any unforced errors. 
Use a range of persuasive devices.
Use exciting and aesthetic font and images in your 
PowerPoint presentation.
Rehearse your speech thoroughly. Practise in front of 
family or friends to help you acclimatise to an 
audience. Consider recording yourself and watch this 
back for feedback. 
A good speaker employs effective volume, varied 
pitch, engaging vocal tone, a moderate pace and 
purposeful gestures. They also use discrete palm cards
– or know their speech – so as to use regular eye 
contact. 
Remember to back up your work, saving it in more 
than one place or even emailing it to yourself. 
Unfortunately, IT issues are not an excuse for late or 
non-submission. 
Your goal is to create a compelling and engaging speech 
which persuades an audience to accept your point of view on 
topic (selected form the options outlined). Make sure have a 
clear conviction and know what you want to say.

I’ll tell you how, because modern life is a catastrophe. Increased\\nmental illnesses and environmental degradation are just some of the reasons.\\nModern life truly sucks. \\nMental illnesses are an increasing problem in the 21st\\ncentury as modern life goes to hell. An apocalypse of mental illnesses are\\nrapidly taking over the world and ruining modern life. People all over the\\nworld are suffering from depression and anxiety and because of this, suicide\\nrates have skyrocketed. According to the Australian Institute of Health and\\nWelfare over 3,000 deaths by suicide occur each year just in Australia. Last\\nyear, there were 3,249 deaths by suicide which is an average of about 9 deaths\\nper day. Modern life is much more harder and stressful. Beyond Blue shows that last year 1.5 million\\npeople living in Australia from the age of 16-85 experienced depression. 1.5\\nmillion! That is a crazy amount of depression. The Australian Bureau of\\nStatistics tells us that anxiety, on the other hand is even higher with 3.4\\nmillion people in Australia experiencing it. In addition to anxiety, depression\\nand suicide rates increasing rapidly, we can also see an increase in\\nenvironmental degradation. \\nDid you know that about 8 million pieces of plastic make\\ntheir way into our ocean each day? Every year 12 million tonnes of plastic are\\ndumped into our ocean. And right now, there are about 5.25 trillion pieces in\\nthe ocean. Why is this, do you think? It’s because of modern society. We are\\ndestroying our earth faster than ever. Pollution rates are increasingly high.\\nThe animal species extinction rate is currently worse than ever. Over 37,000\\nspecies are currently in danger of extinction. While all of this is happening\\nhow can we say that modern life is better than life in the past. Maybe in the\\n1950s they did have limited technology but isn’t it worse to have a limited\\nEarth? \\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that life has become much\\nmore difficult than it was in the past. One of these reasons is because of\\nconstant increases in mental illnesses such as anxiety and depression. Another\\nreason is because of environmental threats and scares that our world is quickly\\nslipping away from us. We must turn things around and make modern life a less\\nstressful and scary time to live.  \\n\\n      teaching material:['argument).
